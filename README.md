# What is Imure?
Imure is a kotlin project I started developing for my friend as a way to help him with server optimization.
## Is this project still being worked on?
No, not at this current state there may be a time where i come back to this project and carry on with it but not now.
## Is it open source?
No, The code will not be open source. This decition may change but as of now it will now.
# Setup
## To set up Imure you will have to do the following:
```
Download the build of Imure for 1.21(Future versions will come)
Place Imure into your plugins folder for Paper(this step is very important as this plugin was built with Paper in mind it does work with spigot but only paper and spigot)
This plugin is still in beta and nothing in here is final
```
